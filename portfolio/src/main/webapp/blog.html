          This week has certainly been an eye-opening first look into web 
          development, and by consequence, front-end development. I've found that 
          I am genuinely challenged yet motivated by the organizational demands 
          involved, and shudder to think of the mess that is currently what I've 
          cobbled together. <br><br>
          However! As chaotic as it has been, processing this deluge of 
          information avavilable online, I feel that I have a solid start to 
          constructing my first website, which has been a goal I have put off 
          for the past three years, since i started my computer science degree. 
          I have a fairly solid vision of how I would like the final website to 
          look at the following 
      <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/8exU9MX39oVoiWhdsyVgO4/portfolio-draft?node-id=1%3A10" target="_blank">figma link.</a><br><br>
          With the home page layout set up, my social links accessible, and 
          this secondary blog page linked to the home page, I would say I am 
          about halfway to the final version I would like to achieve. Coming 
          up next, I would like to have the front page sideways-dropdown menu 
          implemented, and last of all, a playable in-browser game of Snake to 
          thematically tie in with my hobby of game development and the overall 
          arcade cabinet theme of this site.
