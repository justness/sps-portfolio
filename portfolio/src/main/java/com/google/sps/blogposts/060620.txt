That's great!
That's awful!
<p1>This week has certainly been an eye-opening first look into web development, and by consequence, front-end development. I've found that I am genuinely challenged yet motivated by the organizational demands involved, and shudder to think of the mess that is currently what I've cobbled together. However! As chaotic as it has been, processing this deluge of information avavilable online, I feel that I have a solid start to constructing my first website, which has been a goal I have put off for the past three years, since i started my computer science degree. I have a fairly solid vision of how I would like the final website to look at the following <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/8exU9MX39oVoiWhdsyVgO4/portfolio-draft?node-id=1%3A10" target="_blank">figma link.</a>
With the home page layout set up, my social links accessible, and this secondary blog page linked to the home page, I would say I am about halfway to the final version I would like to achieve. Coming up next, I would like to have the front page sideways-dropdown menu implemented, and last of all, a playable in-browser game of Snake to thematically tie in with my hobby of game development and the overall arcade cabinet theme of this site.</p1>
